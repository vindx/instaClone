Hey everyone!

This is Clone of Instagram application from Facebook :)

#### THIS IS NOT REAL INSTAGRAM!

This application has been created just for practice my React JS skills and for fun!

## Before start the project

#### CLIENT PART
In the `root` directory (root folder) run:

### `npm install`

to install all dependencies for correct operation of the application

#### SERVER PART
In the `server` directory (root folder/server) run:

### `npm install`

to install all dependencies for correct operation of the application

## How to start the project

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm client` to start client part
#### `npm server` to start sever part

### `npm dev` for start client and server concurrently

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
