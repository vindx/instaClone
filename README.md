Hey everyone!

This is Clone of Instagram application from Facebook :)

#### THIS IS NOT REAL INSTAGRAM!

This application has been created just for practice my React JS skills and for fun!

To try it on web go to the link:

## Before start the project

#### SERVER PART
In the `root` directory (root folder) run:

### `npm install`

to install all dependencies for correct operation of the application

#### CLIENT PART
In the `server` directory (root folder/client) run:

### `npm install`

to install all dependencies for correct operation of the application

## How to start the project

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm client` runs client part of application
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm server` runs server part of application
Default port - 5000 ([http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000))<br />
The server will reload if you make edits (nodemon).<br />

#### `npm dev` runs both parts (client and server) concurrently
